Hunger is the biggest issue due to the covid-19 pandemic. Many people died in pandemic due to hunger. For pandemic, food distribution is more complicated. Then we think about how we serve food to the roadside civilians free of cost. Firstly our target restaurants. Dhaka city has many restaurants. Many restaurants could not sell all cooked food during dinner. Restaurants can give extra food to roadside civilians. Our delivery rider collects food from restaurants. Then they deliver the food to the roadside civilians. We will create a review page for restaurants. This is the way they can prove they serve fresh food to their customers, not stale food.

After implementing food collection from restaurants, we will try to collect food from local
civilians. In this project, we mainly focus on the restaurant part. Collect food from local civilians
is our upcoming feature.
